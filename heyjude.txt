*Intro*
Tonight[F] I'm gonna have myself[Am] a real good time,[Dm]
I feel alive[Gm] [C]

And the world,[F]
Turning[F7] inside out[B] yeah,
I'm floating[Gm] around in ecstasy[D7] so

Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me[C] now,[Gm7]
Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me[C]

Cause I'm having[Gm] a good time, having[C7] a good time

*Verse 1*
I'm a shooting[F] star leaping through the sky[Am] like a tiger[Dm]
Defying the laws[Gm] of gravity[C]
I'm a racing[F] car, passing by[Am] like lady Godiva[Dm]
I'm gonna go[Gm] go go [C] there's no stopping me[F]
