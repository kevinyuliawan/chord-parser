*Intro*
Tonight[F] I'm gonna have myself[Am] a real good time,[Dm]
I feel alive[Gm] [C]

And the world,[F]
Turning[F7] inside out[B] yeah,
I'm floating[Gm] around in ecstasy[D7] so

Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me[C] now,[Gm7]
Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me[C]

Cause I'm having[Gm] a good time, having[C7] a good time

*Verse 1*
I'm a shooting[F] star leaping through the sky[Am] like a tiger[Dm]
Defying the laws[Gm] of gravity[C]

I'm a racing[F] car, passing by[Am] like lady Godiva[Dm]
I'm gonna go,[Gm] go, go, [C] there's no stopping me[F]

*Prechorus*
I'm burning[F7] through the sky[Bb] yeah,
Two hundred[Gm] degrees, that's why they call[D7] me Mr. Fahrenheit[Gm]
I'm traveling[D7] at the speed of light[Gm]
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you [C]

*Chorus*
Don't[F] stop[Gm] me[Am] now,[Dm]
I'm having such a good[Gm] time,
I'm having[C] a ball

Don't[F] stop[Gm] me[Am] now,[Dm]
If you wanna have a good[Gm] time, just give[D7] me a call

Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me,[C] cause[Gm7] I'm having a good time
Don't[Gm] stop[Dm] me,[C] yes[Gm7] I'm having a good time,
I don't[C7] wanna stop at all[Eb]
